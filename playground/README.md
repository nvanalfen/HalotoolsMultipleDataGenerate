Files in this folder are not test files in the sense that they do not contain tests to be run to ensure consistency. The files in this folder are intended to test certain complex features in an isolated small-scale environment. This way, I know the feature itself works, so if something happens while implementing it, I can check that I have implemented properly and if the error is caused by the more complex code mixing with the implementation.
